# Glossary

## Terms

### Attestation
A cryptographic proof from a device that verifies its authenticity and state.

### Challenge-Response
A security mechanism where one party presents a challenge and another must provide a valid response.

### Entropy
Random data used to ensure uniqueness and prevent predictability in cryptographic operations.

### Liveness Proof
Evidence that a user is currently present and active, not a bot or replay attack.

### Nullifier
A unique value that can only be used once, preventing double-use of proofs.

### Proof-of-Liveness (PoL)
The core primitive of RiftBeacon that verifies real-time user presence.

### Score Decay
Automatic reduction of liveness scores over time to incentivize continued activity.

### Session
A time-bound challenge-response interaction for liveness verification.

### Sybil Attack
An attack where a single entity creates multiple fake identities.

### TEE (Trusted Execution Environment)
Secure area of a processor that protects code and data from tampering.

### WebAuthn
Web standard for passwordless authentication using public key cryptography.

### Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZK)
Cryptographic method to prove possession of information without revealing it.
