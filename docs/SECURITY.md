# Security Policy

## Overview

RiftBeacon is a liveness-based Sybil resistance protocol designed with security as a core principle. This document outlines our security measures, known considerations, and reporting procedures.

## Security Features

### Anti-Replay Protection

- **Nullifier System**: Each proof can only be used once through the NullifierSet contract
- **Session-Based Challenges**: Time-bound challenge-response protocol
- **Unique Session IDs**: Generated using user address, challenge hash, and timestamp

### Access Control

- **Role-Based Permissions**: Using OpenZeppelin's AccessControl
  - `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`: System administration
  - `OPERATOR_ROLE`: Gateway operations
  - `REGISTRAR_ROLE`: Attestation management
  - `CONSUMER_ROLE`: Nullifier consumption
  - `SCORER_ROLE`: Score updates
  - `ENFORCER_ROLE`: Penalty application

### Time-Bound Validation

- **Challenge Windows**: 30 seconds to 10 minutes
- **Attestation Expiry**: Automatic invalidation after expiry
- **Score Decay**: Time-based score reduction for inactive users
- **Blacklist Duration**: Temporary 7-day blacklisting

### Privacy Preservation

- **No Identity Data**: System doesn't store personal information
- **No Biometrics**: Liveness verified without biometric data
- **No Device Fingerprinting**: No persistent device identification
- **Optional ZK Proofs**: Privacy-preserving proof verification

### Anti-Farming Mechanisms

- **Score Threshold**: Minimum score requirements
- **Penalty System**: Automated penalty application
- **Blacklisting**: Repeat offender prevention
- **Cooldown Periods**: Rate limiting on proof generation

## Known Considerations

### Current Implementation

1. **Simplified ZK Verification**: Production should use audited ZK libraries (Groth16, PLONK)
2. **Entropy Generation**: SDK entropy should be enhanced with TEE/WebAuthn
3. **Oracle Dependency**: Off-chain oracle required for advanced attestation
4. **No Upgradeability**: Contracts are not upgradeable (use proxy pattern in production)

### Attack Vectors & Mitigations

#### Sybil Attack
- **Risk**: Creating multiple identities
- **Mitigation**: Nullifier-based uniqueness, entropy requirements, score decay

#### Replay Attack
- **Risk**: Reusing valid proofs
- **Mitigation**: One-time nullifiers, session-based challenges, timestamp validation

#### Front-Running
- **Risk**: Transaction ordering manipulation
- **Mitigation**: Session-specific proofs, time-bound validity, non-transferable scores

#### Denial of Service
- **Risk**: Resource exhaustion
- **Mitigation**: Gas optimization, rate limiting, challenge duration limits

#### Score Manipulation
- **Risk**: Artificial score inflation
- **Mitigation**: Role-based access, decay mechanism, penalty system

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Use Latest Dependencies**: Keep OpenZeppelin and other libraries updated
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Comprehensive test coverage for all scenarios
3. **Audit Smart Contracts**: Professional security audit before mainnet deployment
4. **Monitor Events**: Set up event monitoring for suspicious activity
5. **Rate Limiting**: Implement appropriate cooldown periods
6. **Key Management**: Secure private key storage and rotation

### For Integrators

1. **Minimum Score Requirements**: Set appropriate thresholds for your use case
2. **Multiple Checks**: Don't rely solely on liveness scores
3. **User Education**: Inform users about liveness proof requirements
4. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle failed proofs
5. **Regular Updates**: Stay informed about protocol updates

### For Users

1. **Secure Wallet**: Use hardware wallets or secure key storage
2. **Verify Contracts**: Always verify contract addresses
3. **Understand Permissions**: Review transaction permissions
4. **Regular Activity**: Maintain score through regular participation
5. **Report Issues**: Report suspicious behavior

## Audit Status

**Current Status**: Not audited

**Planned Audits**: Before mainnet deployment

**Recommended Auditors**:
- Trail of Bits
- OpenZeppelin Security
- ConsenSys Diligence
- Sigma Prime

## Vulnerability Disclosure

### Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow responsible disclosure:

1. **Do NOT** open a public issue
2. Email security findings to: `security@riftbeacon.example` (placeholder)
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Based on severity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix deployment (coordinated)

### Bug Bounty

Bug bounty program will be announced after mainnet launch.

**Severity Levels**:
- **Critical**: Immediate loss of funds or complete system compromise
- **High**: Potential loss of funds or significant functionality breach
- **Medium**: Limited impact or specific conditions required
- **Low**: Minor issues with minimal impact
